Welcome to the Mobile Application Pentesting Guide! This guide is designed to help pentesters set up their environment for testing the security of mobile applications on both Android and iOS platforms. We will cover rooting, jailbreaking, and setting up emulators for effective penetration testing.

Mobile application security testing (pentesting) is a crucial step in ensuring the security of mobile apps. This process involves identifying potential vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and security flaws that could be exploited by malicious attackers. To conduct effective pentesting, we need to set up a proper environment that allows us to simulate real-world scenarios. This guide will walk you through the process of rooting, jailbreaking, and setting up emulators for both Android and iOS platforms.

Rooting and Jailbreaking
Rooting Android Devices
Backup: Before proceeding, ensure you have a backup of all important data on the device.

Note: Rooting or jailbreaking may void your device's warranty and could lead to instability or security risks. Use caution and follow instructions carefully.

Here are some useful tools for mobile application pentesting:

Frida: Dynamic instrumentation toolkit for developers, reverse-engineers, and security researchers.
MobSF: Mobile Security Framework for automated pentesting of mobile apps.
Drozer: Comprehensive security testing framework for Android apps.
